A Kristal library that recreates the Piano and Bookshelf puzzles from Deltarune Chapter 4.

### Known Issues:
- Follower's layer isn't properly updated when moving down a FloorTrigger
- Timings for certain things are off (input delays, input buffering, UI transitioning, character walkTo's, etc)
- While DEBUG RENDERING, floor collisions always render. (correct behaviour would be only rendering when player is on their floor.)
- BreakableBookshelf doesn't properly slow down MovingObjects.

## Moving Bookshelves

To make a moving bookshelf puzzle you'll need these things:

A [``RemotePiano``](scripts/world/events/RemotePiano.lua) event with an object property ``"target"`` being a [``MovingBookshelf``](scripts/world/events/MovingBookshelf.lua) event, and an object layer called ``pianocollision``

In your pianocollision layer, Insert rectangles.
These will act as the boundaries to where the MovingBookshelf can move.

![alt text](README-Images/image-3.png)

This is cool but what how do we stand on the bookshelves?

(bare with me)
You'll want to make 4 new object layers.
``objects_floor_1``, ``objects_floor_2``, ``collision_floor_1``, ``collision_floor_2``

![alt text](README-Images/image-5.png)

Any objects within these layers will change depending on your current layer.

You should make ``collision_floor_1`` match what you would normally have on the ``collision`` layer.
(``collision_floor_2`` is special, we'll talk about that in a bit.)

So putting an event like ``Chest`` on ``objects_floor_2`` will make it inaccessible unless you're on layer 2.
But, how do we get to layer 2?

On your ``objects_party`` layer, make a rectangle event called FloorTrigger.
This will be where the player can move up and down the floors.

![alt text](README-Images/image-4.png)

Now, why did I say ``collision_floor_2`` was special?
As you could probably guess, It's the walls the player can collide with on floor 2, BUT;
Not only are the rectangles walls for the player, they're the walls of the bookshelves.

That probably doesn't make much sense when written but I'll try.
The bookshelves "subtract" a 2x2 tile hole at it's current position.
This allows the player to walk on what would usually be the floor below (because it's cutting a hole in the collision)

## Password Pianos
![alt text](README-Images/image-7.png)

(thankfully) These are much simpler.

On an object layer, Make a [``PasswordPiano``](scripts/world/events/PasswordPiano.lua) event and give it the string property ``"pattern"``
This is the password that the piano will use.
Passwords are made up of these characters: ``u, d, l, r, c`` which represents: ``up, down, left, right, center``
You should now be able to see it in game but how will you tell the players what the password *is*?

Make a new [``PasswordPanel``](scripts/world/events/PasswordPanel.lua) event and give it the following properties:
- ``"pattern"`` (``string``) should be the first or second half of your password.
- ``"part"`` (``string``) can be ``start`` or ``end`` (this shows the music sheet icon on the left or the right)
- ``"flag"`` (``string``) the flag that makes it appear. (You can either use a ``setflag`` event or make your own thing to change it.)
- ``"value"`` (``any``) the value the flag has to be to make it appear.
- ``"piano"`` (``object``) the piano it's tied to. (This makes the panel disappear after inputting the password.)

![alt text](README-Images/image-8.png)

Also, You can make a [``MusicGate``](scripts/world/events/MusicGate.lua) event with an object property called ``"piano"`` which should (obviously) be your piano.
This is the gate that's used 1 time. (I made this one in a day it was so simple)

![alt text](README-Images/image-9.png)

## Moving Pianos
Similar to the Moving Bookshelf Puzzles, Make your pianocollision layer (this is the walls, blah blah blah)
Now the fun stuff, Make a [``MovingPiano``](scripts/world/events/MovingPiano.lua) event.

![alt text](README-Images/image-10.png)

You can give it an object property called ``fakeout`` which should be a [``MovingBookshelf``](scripts/world/events/MovingBookshelf.lua) event.
This is like the first Moving Piano in the 2nd Sanctuary.

![alt text](README-Images/image-11.png)

To keep with the 2nd Sanctuary additions,
you can make a [``BreakableBookshelf``](scripts/world/events/BreakableBookshelf.lua) event which will spawn in a.. you guessed it.. breakable bookshelf.
You can set it's string property ``"special"`` to "music_gate" to switch it's texture (and particles) to the breakable music gate found in 3rd Sanctuary.
There's also a string property ``"texture"`` which just overwrites the texture.

![alt text](README-Images/image-14.png) ![alt text](README-Images/image-15.png)


Also, You can make a [``PianoSpeedZone``](scripts/world/events/PianoSpeedZone.lua) event which will change the piano's max speed when entering.
This takes in a float property called ``"max_speed"`` (do I need to explain this?)

Also Also, You can make a [``PianoJumpArea``](scripts/world/events/PianoJumpArea.lua) event which will make the piano jump when entering.

![alt text](README-Images/image-12.png)

Also Also ***ALSO***, You can make a [``PianoExit``](scripts/world/events/PianoExit.lua) event which will make the party jump off of the piano when entering. (this also makes the piano fly into oblivion)
